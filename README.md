#Javascript toSting() method


Time was that you'd need to manually type out Sting and the police lines in your code. Not any more, now javascript's new toSting method replaces strings with random lyrics from popular songs.

> Finally a javascript library worthy of a place in the programming annals of history.

Will Crossland - Senior Engineer, BBC


###Usage

``` javascript
var stuff = "some boring none 'sting and the police' related string";
console.log(stuff.toSting()); // "Dont stand so close to me."
```


####Why
Partly because Synchronicity is sublime, and partly because sometime people can't spell toString(), and this is a fun way to demonstrate those facts.



#####Contribution
Feel free to fork and add more lyrics.
